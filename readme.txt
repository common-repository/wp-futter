This plugin connects to an API and loads in a given Instagram feed. Profile has to be set on public.

== Description ==

Easily display your Instagram feed on your WordPress. Make sure your profile is set to public in order for this plugin to work.

This plugin creates a Vue component to display your feed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My profile is on private, why does the plugin not work? =

The logic to get the data from Instagram currently only works with public profiles. This is because of the Instagram API being inaccessable for private profiles.

= How many items can I show on my page? =

Currently we only support the last 3 items to be shown. In a later version this will be adjustable.

== Instalation ==

1. Download the plugin
2. Activate the plugin
3. On the left side in your admin panel, WP Futter will appear. Configure your Instagram ID
